# Eco Executor🍃
This is a plugin made for developers to pentest or debug their game in the studio. This plugin almost replicates the executor API, and the UI was inspired by the KRNL executor (which has now been shut down)
Also, the executor uses an API called eAPI (a xAPI, but it has been heavily modified to fit perfectly with the level 5 identity since xAPI replicates executor functions and makes it work with level 2 identity scripts)

## Features📦

## Installation📥
Go to [releases](https://github.com/Overhault-Experiences/Eco-Executor/releases) and download the rbxmx file in the latest release.
Insert the rbxmx file into the game and 'save it as local plugin'. There should be a toolbar in the plugins tab (click to config the Eco Executor)
Make sure that in the security settings (game settings at the security section), the Enable Studio Access to API Services and Enable HTTP requests have been enabled, otherwise some functions may not work!

## Warning⚠️
Running in an unpublished game will make some executor functions non-functional/unusable.

## Additional Infoℹ️
### Comment directives
 - `--!noSyntaxCheck`: (Eco Executor's script editor) No error highlights
 - `--!nameFile FileName`: (Save to FileStore) Useful to save a script named properly to file store
 - `--!overwriteFile FileName`: (Save to FileStore) Useful in overwriting an already saved script in file store (so you don't need to delete it and save it again)
